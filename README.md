# PyBer_Analysis.
## Project Overview
Analysis data using python libraries (Pandas and Matplotlib) to visualize the Pyber 2019 spreadsheet data in order to understand trends in ridership 
and fare prices based on city type and neighborhoods.

The data is analyzed to provide summaries of the following information:
1. Total number of rides.
2. Total number of drivers.
3. Total amount of fares.
4. The average fare per ride.
5. The average fare per driver.
6. The total fare by city type

- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.15, Anaconda Navigator 2.1.4, Conda 22.11.1, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8

## Results

### Total number of rides.
<p align="center">

</p>
Suburban cities count for more than 26% of the total rides. Rural cities count for the smallest portion of rides, approximately 5.3%.<br/><br/>

### Total number of drivers.

</p>
Suburban cities count for more than 16% of the total rides. Urban cities have the highest number of drivers for a total of more than 80%. Rural cities count for the smallest number of drivers and total approximately 2.6%.<br/><br/>

### Total number of fares.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/mabulhassan/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/total_fareamt_per_city.png">
</p>
Rural and Suburban cities  make up more than 2/3 of fare amouts per rider with Rural counting for more than 38% of the total rides. Urban cities have count the smallest amount of fare and total approximately 27.2%.<br/><br/>

### Average fare per driver per city.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/mabulhassan/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Average_fare_per_driver_per_city.png">
</p>
Rural cities make up about half of the fare mounts per driver per city with a total of more than 49%. Urban cities have the smallest average of fare per driver and total approximately 14.9%.<br/><br/>

*******************
### The average fare per driver.

<p align="center">
  <img src="h/ttps://github.com/mabulhassan/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Average_fare_per_driver_per_city.png">
</p>
Rural areas have the least number of drivers and rides per city thus the highest amount of fares per driver average make up about 50% of the total. Urban areas have the lowest average of total fare amount per driver.
 

### The total fare by city type
The line chart shows the total fare by city type on a weekly basis starting January to April 2019.

### Summary
Recommendations to address disparities among the city types.
1. Increase transportation in rural areas to improve the average fare per driver percentages. The number of rides in rural areas are only 16% of total cities.
2. Rural areas have significantly higher fare price and lowest number of drivers. Increasing the number of drivers will decrease the fare prices.
3. Increase number of drivers in Suburban cities to tackle the overall increase in fare prices indicated by the weekly driver summary in first half of 2019.
